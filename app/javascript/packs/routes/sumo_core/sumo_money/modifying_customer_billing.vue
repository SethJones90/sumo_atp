          UNIT: MODIFYING CUSTOMER BILLING

          Hello, folks! Today’s lesson: Modifying Subscriptions.

          This includes, Product Replacements, Discount Codes, Gifts, and Credits specifically.

          Each one of the items listed above is a powerful functionality that will allow you to manipulate a customer’s billing. Each has a specific use-case, all are invaluable.

          So, a little less talk, a little more action!

          Product replacements

          Product Replacements are an option available in admin for agents to change the original price of a plan a customer wants to purchase, as well as modify the features associated with said plan.

          Creating a Product Replacement
          Go to the Admin page of a SiteID you want to create the Product Replacement on
          Click on the Product Replacement button at the top-right
          Select the Sumo Pro plan to apply the Product Replacement to.
          Make any necessary modifications to either the monthly price, the yearly price or the monthly traffic limit of the selected plan. Changes to pricing cannot be made on an active subscription.
          Make any necessary modifications to the feature set of the plan. If this is for an active subscription, features can be swapped in and out without the subscription needing to be canceled.
          When you're ready, click Create Product Replacement to finish setting it up.
          Add a note to the Admin Site page describing (1) what you changed and (2) why you changed it.
          If this was a feature replacement, record it in this sheet.

          Modifying an existing Product Replacement
          Click on the link to the existing Product Replacement you want to modify
          Make any necessary modifications to the Product Replacement here.  The options below are the only ones you should need to modify:
          Replacement Product Price: If you need to modify the plan's payment price
          Replacement Sites Included: If you want to add additional "free" sites to the plan.  e.g. change this to 4 if you want someone on Medium Pro to have 3 additional free add-on sites.
          Replacement Add On Site Price: The price of any add-on sites beyond the included number.
          Replacement Product Max Traffic Per Month: Modify this if you want to change the monthly traffic limit of the plan.
          Replacement Product Feature Set: Modify this to change any features of the plan.  Does not require canceling the subscription to take effect.
          Click Save to submit any changes!
          Add a note to the Admin Site page describing (1) what you changed and (2) why you changed it.
          If this was a feature replacement, record it in the sheet below: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uU46Qn4_s_Kpbqy31t_85037We0kqVWvpcnLWGevHSQ/edit#gid=489857654

          Discount Codes

          Discount Codes, like Product Replacements, are a feature available in admin that allows you to discount the original price of plan. However, you cannot alter the features offered in a plan by using a discount code. Nonetheless, a discount code is powerful, as you can provide a discount code for a customer, or multiple customers, to use when purchasing the plan of their choice.

          Creating discount codes

          You can access the Discount Code section of Admin at the link below:

          https://sumo.com/admin/discounts/add

          When you create a code, this is what you'll see:

          Coupon Code

          This is the name you'll be giving to the discount code and present to the customer.  Functionally, you can name it whatever you'd like but there are some suggested naming conventions.

          [prefix]-[customer identifier]-[number] -- so, for example, sa-jamiesan-01
          Prefixes:

          sa = Agency subscription
          ms = Multi-site subscription
          dc = Special discount
          wb = Winback customer

          Identifier: This is basically a way to identify the person/website that will be using the code.
          Number: Typically the ordered number of codes you've given this particular customer.  01 first the first, 02 for the second, and so on. 01 can also stand for primary site discount codes, and 02 for secondary site discount codes.

          Disable Coupon?

          Two options: Yes or No.

          Yes: Disabling a coupon means that it can no longer be redeemed.
          No: Means that the coupon is active and can be redeemed.

          Override Trial Period (# of Days)

          As of the end of June, 2016 we no longer offer trials for subscription plans.  However, this setting will allow you to add a trial period before charging a customer.  Simply enter the number of trial days you want to add before charging the customer.

          Discount only changes trial period.

          If you don't want to offer a discounted plan and only wish to add a trial period before charging the customer, check this box.

          Fixed Discount

          The Fixed Discount option on the Discount Code creation page allows you to deduct a specified fixed dollar amount from the price of a plan.

          This is mutually exclusive with the "Percentage Discount" option.  When selecting "Fixed Discount" you will see an additional field open up below.  In this field, enter the flat discount you want to offer on this plan.

          Example: This discount will be for SumoMe Pro Tier 1 ($25/monthly).  You select "Fixed Discount" and enter 5.  This will discount the plan to $20/monthly.

          Percentage Discount

          The Percentage Discount option on the Discount Code creation page allows you to deduct a specified percentage from the price of a plan.

          This is mutually exclusive with the "Fixed Discount" option.  When selecting "Percentage Discount" you will see an additional field open up below.  In this field, enter the percentage discount you want to offer on this plan.

          Example: This discount will be for SumoMe Pro Tier 1 ($240/yearly).  You select "Percentage Discount" and enter 50.  This will discount the plan to $120/yearly.

          Coupon Duration

          Once This will only apply the discount for the first payment they make.

          Example: You set up a SumoMe Pro Tier 1 ($25/monthly) discount and select a 100% discount Once.  They will pay $0 for the first month, and $25 for subsequent months.
          Repeating: This will apply the discount for a limited number of payments.  When you select this, a new field will open up "Duration (months)".

          Important: Duration (months) does not necessarily mean the number of months the discount is good for.  If you pick a yearly plan, the duration would be the number of years.

          Example: You create a discount code for "Repeating" and set the "Duration" to 2.

          For a yearly subscription plan (e.g. SumoMe Pro Tier 1 ($240/yearly) the discount will last for 2 payments (2 years).

          For a monthly subscription plan (e.g. SumoMe Pro Tier 1 ($25/yearly) the discount will last for 2 payments (2 months).

          Forever: This will apply the discount until the subscription is canceled.

          Unlimited number of redemptions

          Yes = There is no limit to the number of times this code can be applied
          No = There is a limit to the number of times this code can be applied

          Maximum number of redemptions

          This determines the number of times a code can be redeemed before it is expired.

          Must be redeemed by

          The date the discount code must be redeemed before.  After the selected date, the code will expire.

          Valid for any product?

          If you select "Yes" the discount can be applied to any subscription plan.

          Valid for any of the following products

          You can select one or multiple products that the discount will be valid for.

          Invalid for users who've redeemed

          If you select one or multiple products in this list, users trying to redeem the discount who have also redeemed a selected product here will be unable to redeem the discount.

          Applying Discount Codes

          Redeem Agency by Link (does not require store).
          Login to SumoMe.com from the account you wish to own the subscription and will receive all receipts.
          Go to https://sumome.com/agency/redeem
          Enter the VIP Code that was issued
          Enter the SiteID you wish to apply the purchase to.
          Making purchases as the customer

          Credits

          Similar to Product Replacements and Discount Codes, credits are a way to discount the price of a plan, by allowing the customer to pay for a portion or the entirety of the plan with Sumo credit instead of cash. One Sumo credit is the equivalent to one dollar.

          For example, if a customer has been refunded or give 10 Sumo Credits, 10 USD would be deducted from their next payment.

          As stated above, credits can be given instead of, or in combination with, cash when a refund is provided, or they can simply be given to the customer without a refund being processed.

          Credits are tied to email addresses, so if a customer purchases a plan with one email address, and wants to use the credit when buying a plan with another email address, unfortunately this will not be possible.

          In order to refund in credit, navigate to Refund Central on the customer’s Site Admin page, and enter the desired credit to be refunded in the “Refund Credit” column instead of “Refund Cash”

          In order to simply give a customer credit, navigate to the “Add/Remove Credit from an Account” in the Sumo admin section.

          You will then be given the option enter the email address in which you want to apply the credit, then you will be able to select the credit (or negative credit) applied to the account. Negative credit simply deducts from the current total.

          For example, if a user has 40 credits on their account, adding -40 credits, will zero out the credit, and the user will not have any credit left to user on their account.

          Gifts

          Gifts are also a useful tool if you want to get a customer access to a plan, free of charge. When gifting a product to a customer, you can choose the expiration date for the plan, if any, the plan you want to gift, and the SiteIDs or email addresses to apply the gift to.

          Choosing SiteIDs will allow you to choose the specific SiteIDs to apply the gift to, and choosing an email address will allow you to apply the gift to all SiteIDs listed under the email address.

          Applying gifts is useful when a customer is on a legacy multisite plan, where the functionality for adding sites to plan didn’t exist yet. You can also use it as an incentive for a customer to stay with Sumo, or as a temporary fix for customers who cannot access the features on their plan due to a product bug.

          Common Issues

          A Customer wants to sign up to a legacy plan (product replacement needed)

          There are many occasions when a customer wants to sign up for a legacy plan, but because the customer has multiple sites, purchasing through a legacy link is not the best option.

          When this is the case, and you have permission to do this, you will need to simulate the legacy plan by purchasing the most comparable plan, and modifying the price of the plan and the features within the plan, so that it is identical to the legacy plan.

          This is done by using a product replacement. Discount codes are not applicable in this situation because they do not allow you to modify the feature set of the plan.

          A Customer needs features added

          In some cases, it is necessary to add features to a plan in order to close a sale, or prevent a cancellation.

          When this is the case, you would simply create a product replacement for the plan the customer is currently on, and modify the features within the plan. You can do this by simply checking and unchecking features available after creating the product replacement.

          Note: Make sure you do not change the price of this plan!

          Once you have selected the desired features, simply save the Product Replacement. The features will be immediately added. No need to cancel the plan. It’s Sumo magic!

          A Customer needs a trial applied

          There are certain situations when you want to apply a trial period to a purchase. This could be because the customer wants some free days on their plan, and this has been authorized in order to close the sale, or perhaps you need to setup another plan but the customer shouldn’t be charged for a period of time.

          Adding a trial period to a plan via a discount code would likely be the optimal solution in this situation.

          In order to do this, add the number of days for the trial in the “Override Trial Period (# of Days)” section of the discount code creation form.

          Once this is done, purchase the plan with the newly created discount code.

          Credits being applied to another email address

          When refunding or gifting credits to a customer, it is important to note that credits are applied to the email address/account of the customer - not a SiteID. Why is this important?

          You may find that a customer has multiple SiteIDs and the customer purchased the plan on the wrong SiteID. The desired SiteID is listed under another email address.

          When this is the case, you can certainly refund the customer credit for the accidental purchase, but the credit will not be applied to the email address that owns the desired SiteID.

          Because of this, you will need to remove the credit from the email address you initially refunded the credit to, then gift that same amount of credit to the email address that owns the desired SiteID.

          Note: You must 1) get permission to do this and 2) you must leave notes on both SiteIDs outlining what you did specifically.

          Gifting a plan

          In some of our legacy plans, the option to add secondary sites to a subscription does not exist. Because we cannot apply discount codes to reduce the price of the plan on a secondary site by 100% in order to add the site to a plan, you will need to gift the plan in order for the customer to use Pro features, free of charge on their secondary site.

          Remember to leave notes!
