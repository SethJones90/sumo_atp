          UNIT: SUBSCRIBING TO AND CHANGING PLANS

          Hello, agents in training!

          Let’s get down to business, to def…. to discuss upgrading and downgrading plans.

          All too often, customers will purchase a plan and either reduce costs or upgrade to a more full featured plan.

          Whatever the reason, being able to address these concerns will separate the masters from the novices.

          Plan upgrades/downgrades

          Upgrading and downgrading plans should be self explanatory. When a customer wants to upgrade their plan, they would like to purchase a more expensive plan than their current one, and if they want to downgrade, they want to switch to a plan that is less expensive instead.

          When a customer either upgrades or downgrades between Sumo Pro plans, our system automatically handles things.

          Users upgrading plans

          Any remaining subscription time will be added to the subscriber's account as Sumo credit.

          The difference between the new subscription plan's payment and their credit total will be charged to the default payment method.

          The user is then set up with a fresh subscription starting the same day.

          Example:

          User starts out with $0 in Sumo credit and is on Sumo Pro Small ($49/monthly) which ends in 3 days.

          User wants to upgrade to Sumo Pro Medium ($99/monthly)

          When they upgrade, the remaining 3 days is added as Sumo Credit

          (3 days / 30 days) * $49 payment = $4.90 credit

          Then their credit is applied toward the first month's payment of Medium

          $99.00 monthly payment - $4.90 Sumo credit = $94.10 charged to the default payment method

          The next $99 payment is now on the same day next month.

          Users downgrading plans

          Any remaining subscription time will be added to the subscriber's account as Sumo credit

          A new month's payment on the new plan is immediately charged.

          Example:

          User starts out with $0 in Sumo credit and is on Sumo Pro Medium ($99/monthly) which ends in 5 days.

          User wants to downgrade to Sumo Pro Small ($49/monthly) and their traffic supports that

          When they downgrade, the remaining 5 days are added as Sumo credit

          (5 days / 30 days) * $99 payment = $16.50 credit

          Then their credit is applied toward the first month's payment of Small

          $49.00 monthly payment - $16.50 credit = $32.50 charged to the default payment method

          The next $49 payment is now on the same day of next month

          Modifying a Sumo Pro Subscription

          If a user wants to modify (upgrade or downgrade) their Sumo Pro subscription, such as change the actual plan or billing interval, this can all be handled in admin on the users Site admin page.

          Here’s how you would handle this:

          Grab the users information and navigate to the SiteID admin page that has their Pro subscription that they want to modify

          Scroll down to the Inventory Items section and click on the name of the active subscription they want modified (should be a link)

          Now that you are on the Inventory Admin page, you can make the following changes:

          [A] Switch Interval: This section allows you to change the billing interval such as moving from a monthly billing plan to a yearly billing plan or vice versa. *

          If switching from Yearly to Monthly, the difference will be issued to the customer's Sumo account as credit, not refunded as cash.  If you'll be issuing a cash refund, then be sure to remove credit after refunding any cash

          [B] Switch Plan: This section allows you to change the actual plan level you are on, such as upgrading from Sumo Pro Small to Sumo Pro Monthly. **

          If switching from a more expensive plan to a less expensive one, the difference will be issued to the customer's Sumo account as credit, not refunded as cash.  If you'll be issuing a cash refund, then be sure to remove credit after refunding any cash

          * When you change the billing interval of a plan, this will NOT affect the level of the plan they are on at all.

          ** When you change the level of the plan, this will NOT affect the billing interval at all.

          NOTE: Sometimes credits are not automatically applied after refunding credit to a customer. For this reason, it is recommended to double check https://sumo.com/admin/credits after refunding credit to a customer to ensure the customer has actually received the proper amount of credit.

          Subscribing to old plans

          Subscribing to old plans is possible.  The only situations this should be done in are below (This should only be done with approval from someone Level 2 or above):

          There was an agreement or promise to put the user on this plan ahead of time.

          Major caveat:

          This should only be done for users who have a single Site on their account or if they don't care which Site the subscription ends up on.  Using this method, you cannot choose which Site to put the subscription on.  It will be whichever site is at the top of the list on their sumo.com/sites page.

          Steps to set up:

          Go to the User Admin page of the user who will have the subscription set up.

          Click on the Sign In As User button

          After you're signed in as the user, open one of the Upgrade Links from the table below, depending on the plan you want to put them on.

          Select the correct billing period (monthly | yearly) and optionally apply a discount code, then click the Checkout button to finalize the subscription.

          Common Issues

          A customer wants to Switch from a Legacy Plan To a Current Plan

          In the event that a customer wants to switch from a legacy plan to a current plan, you will need to cancel the user’s legacy plan, and apply any credit if applicable.

          Once this is done, you will need to subscribe the customer to one of our current plans.

          Unfortunately this is not an automated process, and will need to be done manually.

          Prorated refunds

          When moving a subscription from one subscription to another, you will sometimes need to prorate credit for the amount of time the customer has not used on their current plan.

          When prorating credit, you will generally want to prorate at the monthly rate. However, if a customer is upgrading a plan, you may find it acceptable to prorate at the annual rate instead, since the customer is staying with us and giving us more money.

          A customer wants to sign up for a legacy plan

          Generally if a customer writes in, wanting to sign up for one of our legacy plans, you should let the customer know that we are unable to sign them up for a legacy plan, since these are no longer in our inventory. Then you should direct them to our current plans instead.

          However, there may be situations where it is best to sign the customer up for a legacy plan instead. An example of this might be if their legacy subscription was cancelled to a card being expired that they didn’t know was expired, or a plan being cancelled due to a bug on our end.

          When this is the case, you can follow one of our links for purchasing legacy plans.
